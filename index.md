## Introduction

This project investigates the connection between El Nino, the Arctic Oscillation and Arctic Surface Albedo. Since Both ENSO and AO effect air temperature and precipitation, both phenomena should have an impact on albedo measured in the arctic. Colder temperatures and increased precipitation would yield more snowfall and less melting of ice. This project attempts to demonstrate that by simple correlation of monthly averages of albedo reflectance and the two indeces. The Arctic System Reanalysis dataset was selected because it contains a many variables that could be used for physical modeling of changes in arctic surface reflectance - a critical climate feedback dynamic.



## Data

Arctic System Re-Analysis (Version 2) data from National Center for Atmospheric Research and Ohio State University was selected. The dataset is available at UCAR Research Data Archive: https://rda.ucar.edu/datasets/ds631.1/. It was produced from Polar Weather Research and Forecasting Model (PWRF) and High Resolution Land Data Assimilation (HRLDAS) weather research models. 

ASR contains multiple products. This project uses ASRv2 15km monthly means of analysis products. The data product is presented on a 15km irregular grid. For analysis, it's regridded 0.1 degree grid using the ESMF 'bilinear' method.

ASR `ALBEDO` variable is used. Albedo is a fractional values from 0.0 to 1.0. It represents solar radiation reflection with 1.0 representing maximum reflection of solar energy. Real snow and reflects energy unevenly across the EMF spectrum - albedo is a one number approximation of EMF reflectivity.  

Arctic Oscillation (or Northern Hemisphere Annular Mode) index is correlated with albedo anomalies to explore the feedback between atmospheric circulation and land. AO  the primary atmospheric mode in the Arctic and has many effects that are detailed here: https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/teleconnections/ao/

"The Arctic Oscillation (AO) is a large scale mode of climate variability, also referred to as the Northern Hemisphere annular mode. The AO is a climate pattern characterized by winds circulating counterclockwise around the Arctic at around 55Â°N latitude. When the AO is in its positive phase, a ring of strong winds circulating around the North Pole acts to confine colder air across polar regions. This belt of winds becomes weaker and more distorted in the negative phase of the AO, which allows an easier southward penetration of colder, arctic airmasses and increased storminess into the mid-latitudes."

Nino34 index is also used. It describes the intensity of El Nino/La Nina modes in terms of gradient in sea surface temperature of two locations in the Pacific Ocean.


## Code Description and Technical Issues

The code is available at https://github.com/juozasg/clim-data/blob/master/FinalProject.ipynb. Additional notebooks in the same repository are used to convert ASR monthly NetCDF files for years 2000 to 2016 into two files for that time range, one containing climatologies and the other anomalies. Multiple variables are available but only ALBEDO is used so far. 


ASR products are presented on a custom grid, so all calculations and visualization workflows must include a step that converts from the irregular ASR grid to a rectangular lat/lon grid. Initially I've chosen to perform regridding as the last step to reduce computation costs, however that makes more complex statistical functions harder to apply correctly so in the future the data should be regridded as the initial step.



## Results

Only a basic statistical analysis and exploratory visualization was successfully performed.  It showed correlation between AO and albedo and also correlation between Nino 3.4 and albedo. There are intriguing regional geographic differences that seem to reflect the atmospheric changes associated with these modes. Additionally, because ice or groundwater should delay the manifestations of AO and ENSO climate patterns on albedo. Different timeseries statistical techniques could potentially be used to characterize that. 

## Summary

The indexes and ASR data sets show distinct connection between AO and Nino34 modes. ASR dataset can be used to investigate the connections beween other physical variables (for example soil moisture or sea ice thickness), surface albedo, and AO and Nino34 modes.
