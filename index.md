# Exploring ENSO and AO impacts on Arctic System Reanalysis Albedo Fraction

## Introduction

This project investigates the connection between El Nino, the Arctic Oscillation and Arctic Surface Albedo. Since Both ENSO and AO effect air temperature and precipitation, both phenomena should have an impact on albedo measured in the arctic. Colder temperatures and increased precipitation would yield more snowfall and less melting of ice. This project attempts to demonstrate that by simple correlation of monthly averages of albedo reflectance and the two indeces. The Arctic System Reanalysis dataset was selected because it contains a many variables that could be used for physical modeling of changes in arctic surface reflectance - a critical climate feedback dynamic.



## Data

Arctic System Re-Analysis (Version 2) data from National Center for Atmospheric Research and Ohio State University was selected. The dataset is available at UCAR Research Data Archive: https://rda.ucar.edu/datasets/ds631.1/. It was produced from Polar Weather Research and Forecasting Model (PWRF) and High Resolution Land Data Assimilation (HRLDAS) weather research models. 

ASR contains multiple products. This project uses ASRv2 15km monthly means of analysis products. The data product is presented on a 15km irregular grid. For analysis, it's regridded 0.1 degree grid using the ESMF 'bilinear' method.

ASR `ALBEDO` variable was analyzed. Albedo is a fractional values from 0.0 to 1.0. It represents solar radiation reflection with 1.0 representing maximum reflection of solar energy. Real snow and reflects energy unevenly across the EMF spectrum - albedo is a one number approximation of EMF reflectivity.  

Arctic Oscillation (or Northern Hemisphere Annular Mode) index is correlated with albedo anomalies to explore the feedback between atmospheric circulation and land. AO  the primary atmospheric mode in the Arctic and has many effects that are detailed here: https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/teleconnections/ao/

"The Arctic Oscillation (AO) is a large scale mode of climate variability, also referred to as the Northern Hemisphere annular mode. The AO is a climate pattern characterized by winds circulating counterclockwise around the Arctic at around 55Â°N latitude. When the AO is in its positive phase, a ring of strong winds circulating around the North Pole acts to confine colder air across polar regions. This belt of winds becomes weaker and more distorted in the negative phase of the AO, which allows an easier southward penetration of colder, arctic airmasses and increased storminess into the mid-latitudes."

Nino34 index was also used. It describes the intensity of El Nino/La Nina modes in terms of gradient in sea surface temperature of two locations in the Pacific Ocean.


## Code Description and Technical Issues

The code is available at https://github.com/juozasg/clim-data/blob/master/FinalProject.ipynb. Additional notebooks in the same repository are used to convert ASR monthly NetCDF files for years 2000 to 2016 into two files for that time range, one containing climatologies and the other anomalies. Multiple variables are available but only ALBEDO is used so far. 


ASR products are presented on a custom grid, so all calculations and visualization workflows must include a step that converts from the irregular ASR grid to a rectangular lat/lon grid. Initially I've chosen to perform regridding as the last step to reduce computation costs, however that made more complex statistical functions harder to apply correctly. During later project revision all gridding computation were performed first (using auxilary notebooks) and analysis was performed on the regridded ASR products. 

The following additional notebooks were used for data pre-processing:

* CalculateClimAndAnom - calculate climatologies and anomalies on the original ASR grid
* LoadAOandNino - format the Nino34 and AO indeces into NetCDF files on the same temporal grid and extent as other data
* RegridAll - convert all anomaly data from the original ASR grid to the regular 0.1 degree lat-lon grid


## Results

Statistical analysis and exploratory visualization was successfully performed.  It showed statistically significant correlation between AO and albedo and also correlation between Nino 3.4 and albedo. Composite analysis showed that two distinct modes of AO had statistically significant regional differences in albedo. There are expected regional geographic differences were mainly observed at the 50-60N zone which reflects the atmospheric changes associated with the AO modes.

Direct correlation is somewhat surprising because there should be lag between temperature and precipitation changes represented by the two indeces and the occurance of ice and snow that causes higher albedo values. For example, if AO changes causes higher precipitation during the non-freezing time of the year and so increases soil moisture volume that should lead to more ice on the surface months later, during the winter. Different temporal statistical techniques and more elaborate physical modeling of snow and ice formation could potentially be used to characterize that. Simultaneously, the seasonal differences in AO/ENSO and albedo correlations should be explored because in the coldest and warmest months AO and ENSO patterns impact on temperature and moisture should contribute less to albedo anomalies than during times of year that are boundaries between freezing and thawing. 

## Summary

The indexes and ASR data sets show distinct connection between AO and Nino34 modes. ASR dataset can be further used to investigate the connections beween other physical variables (for example soil moisture or sea ice thickness), surface albedo, and AO and Nino34 modes.
