## Introduction

This project investigates the connection between El Nino, the Arctic Oscillation and Arctic Surface Albedo 

## Data

Arctic System Re-Analysis (Version 2) data is used. The dataset is available at UCAR Research Data Archive: https://rda.ucar.edu/datasets/ds631.1/

"The Arctic System Reanalysis (ASR) is produced using a high-resolution version of the Polar Weather Research and Forecasting Model (PWRF) and High Resolution Land Data Assimilation (HRLDAS) systems that have been optimized for the Arctic."

ASR contains multiple products. This project uses ASRv2 15km monthly means of analysis products. The data product is presented on a 15km irregular grid. For analysis, it's regridded 0.1 degree grid using the ESMF 'bilinear' method.

ALBEDO variable is used. ALBEDO is a fractional values from 0 to 1 that represents solar radiation reflection from dark material that has no reflection (ALBEDO = 0) to full reflection by snow surface (ALBEDO = 1)
